<h3>Tired Of Ditto Note 3 Or 4?</h3>
Touchwiz is great but a bit boring.  It is also cumbersome to manually change DPI per each app instead of just changing a system-wide DPI through build prop.  On top of this, Ditto Note 4 is on Kit Kat.  Although you can get most of these features through xposed mod, it takes some hunting down and trial and error.  I also noticed GPS was iffy at this moment with Ditto Note 4 for many of its users.
<h3>Enter Wilson3q's Lollipop Rom!</h3>
This rom is a relative newcomer to the Note 2 Android Development scene and I was really impressed by the stability of this rom.  Check out my <a href="http://frankshin.com/best-note-2-rom-n7105-sgh-i317-i317m/">initial review here</a>.  Today is a continuation of that review.
<h3>AGNI Kernel</h3>
The AGNI Kernel is by far the best kernel I've used, if you can get it installed.  With the latest wilson3q's roms, it is a bit tricky, as you will boot into a black screen.  What worked for me is this.

1. Download the <a href="http://frankshin.com/files/android/kernel/PSN_pureCM_11-12_ANYROM-AROMA-v2.9.1_R2_N7105_OC.zip">PSN_pureCM_11-12_ANYROM-AROMA-v2.9.1_R2_N7105_OC.zip</a>

2. Download <a href="http://frankshin.com/files/android/kernel/AGNi_MALI_R3P2-rel3_API-23_blobs.zip">AGNi_MALI_R3P2-rel3_API-23_blobs.zip</a>

3. Wipe both caches

4. Install the kernel, then install the blobs

5. Wipe both caches

6. Reboot
<h3>AGNI Settings</h3>
If you aren't too sure how to configure AGNI, take a look at the bottom of my <a href="http://frankshin.com/cyanide-4-lollipop-rom-n7105-sgh-i317-sgh-i317m-note-2/">Cyanide V4 Review</a> where I wrote the settings I use.
