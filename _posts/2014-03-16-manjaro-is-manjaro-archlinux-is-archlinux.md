Every so often there is a Manjaro user who believes he/she is running Archlinux showing up on the<a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/"> Arch Forums</a> or #archlinux on Freenode.  They have a hard time coming to realization that the Manjaro they are using is not Archlinux.  Personally, I do not care what distro is used as everyone has their own preference but we should all know what we are using.  When I took a look at the Manjaro Forums, it is apparent why people think Manjaro is Arch.

1. People write threads talking about Manjaro with words like "My archlinux install" on the Manjaro forums.

2. Manjaro is advertised as an Archlinux based spinoff.

3. Misinformed youtube'rs who refer to Manjaro as Arch on training wheels and other silly descriptions.

Here is a quote from the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Forum_etiquette#Arch_Linux_Distribution_Support_ONLY">Arch Forums rules</a>:
<blockquote>Arch-based distributions often use different packages, package versions, repositories, and make custom system configurations surreptitiously, constituting support for such projects quite impossible on the Arch forums. Community technical support shall only be provided for the Arch Linux distribution and the Arch User Repository. Threads concerning issues with, and requesting support for, derivate distributions, or operating systems other than Arch Linux are strictly prohibited and will be closed.</blockquote>
<strong>Wait! Isn't Manjaro based off Arch?  Therefore I'm using Arch right?</strong>

No.  Manjaro does not follow the KISS (keep it simple stupid) philosophy that drives Arch's core.  Also, the repos and packages do differ as well as system configurations.  Manjaro seems to have hand picked pieces of Arch and created their own frankenstein version that although from far away seems to resemble Arch, a closer inspection will show that they are very, very different distros.

Here is a quote from the <a href="http://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Manjaro_FAQ#Is_Manjaro_just_an_easy-to-install_version_of_Arch.3F">Manjaro FAQ</a>:
<blockquote>
<h3>Is Manjaro just an easy-to-install version of Arch?</h3>
No. Manjaro is unlike other Arch-based distributions such as <i>Archbang</i> or <i>Bridge Linux</i>. While there are numerous subtle differences between Manjaro and Arch, the most obvious examples, including the use of our own dedicated software repositories, are covered in the <b><a title="About Manjaro" href="http://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=About_Manjaro">About Manjaro</a></b> page.
<h3>Can Manjaro use the Arch Software Repositories?</h3>
No. Manjaro is configured to use its own dedicated software repositories, although you can still access the community-maintained Arch User Repository (AUR) for additional software, if you wish. In addition, if you want to access the very latest <i>bleeding-edge</i> software, Manjaro's own testing and unstable repositories are also available.</blockquote>
