Hello Readers,

I recently launched my blog a few days ago with the <a href="http://www.frankshin.com/installing-archlinux-on-macbook-air-2013/">installation of Archlinux on my Macbook Air 6,2 (mid 2013)</a>. Since the launch I've had a number of visitors to my page and I surely do not wish to give off the impression that this is a one post blog.  The truth is, I've been spending the last couple of days securing this site as well as editing permissions so that my Wordpress plugins, updates, and uploads are functional.

The next few posts will be on setting up a CLI userland on Archlinux with DWM + apps (rtorrent, mutt, tmux, vim, etc).  And most importantly, how to make them look pretty.  As a breather I may make a post about how to function in Putty for those who wish to ssh into their box while they are using a windows client (work/school/etc).  This blog is going to be orientated to an intermediate level of crowd but that doesn't mean beginners will not benefit.  I will dumb down most of the content because truth be told, I am a dummy myself.

To those that do not know me, here is a photo of my wife and I when we were in Thailand last month.
