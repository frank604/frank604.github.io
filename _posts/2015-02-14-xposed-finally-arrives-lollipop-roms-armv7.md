<h3>Xposed Framework For Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (n7105, sgh-i317, sgh-i317m)</h3>
When I first read <a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/xposed-framework-lollipop-540928/">this article</a>, I was heartbroken to see that the dev for xposed wasn't in any hurry to get xposed updated to work on ART instead of Dalvik.  I was one of the many who didn't want to upgrade to lollipop without xposed.  However, with lollipop's awesome battery saving ability, I crossed over saying goodbye to the many wonderful xposed apps I grew quite fond of.

As of this week, xposed has been released to armv7 devices only.  Thankfully, the note 2 is one of these devices.

Please ensure you understand how to use odin, custom recovery, are rooted, and have a nandroid backup.
