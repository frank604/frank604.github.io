Just wanted to let everyone know that I have rma my xps 13 9350. I won't be able to do any updates to my github or posts until it is returned hopefully within the month.

Many thanks to our linux community who have personally reached out and helped. I tried them all but I realized my bios is too corrupt to fix by current troubleshooting methods.

Take care.
