My wife is from Hong Kong so with the birth of our first born daughter we traveled to Hong Kong!  I just arrived and am connected through a 3G data router.  I will try to write a few posts here and there but am not sure if I'll have the time to do so.  I'll be here for a month so if you have any recommendations of cool tech places to check out, then let me know!
