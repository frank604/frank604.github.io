On the launch date, I decided to give my mother my Note 2 and purchase an S6 Edge.  I will stop writing about Note 2 and begin updating on my findings with the S6 Edge.  This is the Canadian variant W8.

PS.  Sorry I haven't updated in a few months.  I've been busy traveling for the past couple months and now I'm back home and caught up with work!
