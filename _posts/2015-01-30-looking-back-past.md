<h3>Looking Back At How Far We Came</h3>
Today I take a moment to look back at the shared memories I've had with my wife.  We've known each other for almost 8 years now? Or is it 7?  Time literally flew on a jet plane.  Do you remember how happy we were to finally be done with college?  We both left Nelson, BC with adventure in our eyes.  You would be living and working in Whistler and I would be in Vancouver.  Thinking back to those days brings out some good memories.  I wanted to remind you of them.

The phrase "opposites attract" really defines us.  Without being too mushy I just want to thank you for being a wonderful home maker.  You've made me into a better person and that is the real test of a relationship.  We should push each other to better ourselves and perhaps pick up a new talent or two.  I admit, I haven't been the perfect partner but I've given my all.

We've traveled the world together and settled down to start a family.  I'm excited to start this new adventure with you in being a parent.  Looking forward to other adventures on the near horizon.  Don't forget the memories we've made.  This ones for you :)
